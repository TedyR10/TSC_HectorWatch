# Hector Watch

### Description
* This project focuses on creating a smart watch from the ground up using
certain parts provided by the TSC Team. The smart watch has the following
features: 6 axis intertial unit, haptic motor driver, LiPo battery,
USB C, 1.28 inch 240x240p LCD display.

***

### Steps to developing the watch
* 1. Electrical scheme implementation
* 2. PCB design

***

### Electrical scheme implementation
* The provided electrical scheme was implemented using Fusion 360's schematic feature,
then the components were linked to the PCB design.

***

### PCB design
* The PCB design was done using Fusion 360's PCB design feature. The routes were done
manually, routing with 0.3mm for the power lines and 0.127mm for the signal lines. I
decided not to place the test pads in a specific location, but rather place them in
a way that would allow me to fully connect the components.

***

### Final thoughts
* The project was a great experience, as it allowed me to learn how to use Fusion 360's
schematic and PCB design features. I also learned how to properly route the PCB and
how to properly place the components. I am looking forward to the next project.
